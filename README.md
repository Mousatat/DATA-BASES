# DATA-BASES
This repository for Data bases course which include labs and exams from Innopolis university bachelor degree third year spring semester 2022

While the course Data Modelling and Databases the professor covered the core concepts behind database design and the relational model, there are further considerations that should be addressed to pursue a career in this field. This course will expand upon what it has been presented in DMD I course with focus on both software design, under the form of conceptual and logical DB design, and physical optimization. More attention will be given to the functioning of Database Management Systems (DBMS), looking at the internal implementation details.
